Create a form with following controls and validators

1) Project Name ('should not be empty)
2) Mail (should not be empty and valid email)
3) project status dropdown with 3 potential values: 'stable', 'criticial', 'Finished'
4) submit button

Add your own validator that does not allow 'test' as a project Name
also implement that validator as an async Validator (replace the other one)

Upon submitting the form simply print the values to console
